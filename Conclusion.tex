\section{Conclusion}
For this project the Fermi energy of aluminium was determined through the angular correlation of annihilation radiation. A $^{22}$Na was used as a positron source, the positrons annihilate with electrons in aluminium surrounding the $^{22}$Na. After fitting a function as closely as possible function to the measured, a Fermi energy of 12.46~eV was found. The discrepancy with the value of 11.65~eV found in literature\cite{Massalski1978151, ashcroft1976solid} is most likely due to errors in the fitting process.
