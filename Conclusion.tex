\section{Conclusion}
The simulated model corresponded with what was physically expected. Physically, we expect the temperature to be continuous everywhere and the derivative of the perpendicular component at the lower, righter and upper boundary to vanish. These conditions can be seen to be met in the simulations. When the heat coefficient parameter $\alpha$ is increased, the temperature gradient near the boundary is higher. This corresponds physically to the ability of the material to conduct heat.
