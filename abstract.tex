A finite-element method simulation was performed to approximately solve the steady state distribution of the  two-dimensional heat equation on a square domain. The domain consists of two parts, $A$ and $B$, where $B$ is centered in the middle of the domain and $A$ forms its complement. $A$ and $B$ have different values for the heat conductivity $k$. The boundary conditions consist of two Dirichlet boundary conditions on opposite sides, a Neumann boundary condition and a Robin boundary condition. The modelled results corresponded to physical expectations.
